/ A set of constants for precedence-based expression parsing.
// Non-operators have lowest precedence, followed by operators
// starting with precedence 1 up to unary operators. The highest
// precedence serves as "catch-all" precedence for selector,
// indexing, and other operator and delimiter tokens.

def k_lowest_prec int = 0  // non-operators
def k_unary_prec const int = 6
def k_highest_prec const int = 7
